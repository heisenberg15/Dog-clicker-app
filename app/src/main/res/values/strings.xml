        Simple clicker can be very powerful tool to teach your dog or cat new behaviours.
        Here are some tips for using clicker:\n

        <b><i>1</i></b>. Before you can use the clicker for training purposes, you will need to teach your dog what the clicker means to him. While you are in the room with your dog, press on the clicker once. When your dog turns to you at the sound of the click, immediately give him the treat. Repeat this several times.\n
        <b><i>2</i></b>. Pay attention how you\'r dog reacts to the clicker. Some dogs may be sensitive to the sound of the clicker. If your dog runs away when he hears the clicker, the sound is probably a little too harsh for him, so turn down a volume little bit.\n
        <b><i>3</i></b>. Once your dog has learned what to expect with the sound of the clicker, you can use it to train him to do different commands. Click during desired behavior not after it is completed. The timing of the click is crucial.Don\'t be dismayed if your pet stops the behavior when it hears the click. The click ends the behavior. Give the treat after that.\n
        <b><i>4</i></b>. Always Follow a Click with a Treat. Remember that the Clicker is the signal that a reward is coming, rather than being the reward itself. With the clicker, your dog will learn two main thingsâ€“the exact moment that he is doing the right thing, and that a treat always comes after the click.\n
        <b><i>5</i></b>. Add a verbal cue. You will say the cue first and then wait for your dog to do the desired behavior. As soon as he does the behavior, click and reward him with a treat. Your verbal cue should be short and direct, such as \"sit\" or \"down.\" Sentences, such as \"Be a good boy and stay\" or \"Roll over for mommy\" would be too long.\n
        <b><i>6</i></b>. Don\'t wait for the \"whole picture\" or the perfect behavior. Click and treat for small movements in the right direction. You want the dog to sit, and it starts to crouch in back: click. You want it to come when called, and it takes a few steps your way: click.\n
        <b><i>7</i></b>. Keep raising your goal. As so on as you have a good response-when a dog, for example, is voluntarily lying down, coming toward you, or sitting repeatedly-start asking for more.
